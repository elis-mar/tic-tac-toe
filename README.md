## Tic-tac-toe with minimax AI
This is a simple tic-tac-toe game written in Python, with Pygame. It features a Minimax AI that can play optimally and is optimised with alpha-beta pruning for performance. The game allows you to choose between playing as player 1 (X), or player 2 (O) and directs you to a play again screen after each match.

### How to play.
Make sure Python and Pygame installed:

pip install pygame

Then run the game:

python main.py
